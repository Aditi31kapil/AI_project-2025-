## Overview
The Smart Firefighter Simulation models a firefighter tasked with extinguishing fires in an efficient manner. The simulation incorporates various pathfinding algorithms to showcase their unique characteristics while navigating a grid-like environment.

## Algorithms Used
The following algorithms are implemented in the simulation:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Depth-First Search with Iterative Deepening (DFS-ID)
- Beam Search
- Best-First Search
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search
- Greedy Search

## Simulation Details
In this simulation, the firefighter must:
- Fill water buckets from hydrants (maximum of 5 buckets).
- Extinguish all fires (each fire requires 2 water buckets).
- Navigate to the finish position.

### Costs
- Each move costs 1 unit.
- Filling water costs 2 units.

## How It Works
- The simulation uses **Manhattan distance** to find the nearest target (hydrant or fire).
- The selected algorithm plans the path to that target, ensuring sensible behavior while demonstrating the unique characteristics of each algorithm.
